# Usage

This repo requires a mainnet rpc provider, but don't worry! You won't need to spend any real money. We are going to be `forking` mainnet, and pretend as if we are interacting with mainnet contracts.

All you'll need, is to set a `MAINNET_RPC_URL` environment variable in a `.env` file that you create. You can get setup with one for free from [Alchemy](https://www.alchemy.com/).

Run:

```sh
yarn hardhat run scripts/aaveBorrow.js
```
